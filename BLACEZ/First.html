    <details><summary>HTML:</summary><p class="para3">HTML is really a developer’s bread and butter. If you have any interaction with code, website or app builds in your job or day-to-day life you need to know this language. To see how vital HTML and technology is, take your smartphone out of your pocket. How many apps do you have? How often do you use the browsers? Do you use it for shopping or to make purchases? Does it control things, like the temperature of your home? Do you use it to book hotels, flights, haircuts, or anything else? Do you use it to order food or to listen to or watch something online? All of this relies on HTML.</p>

    <details><summary>Css:</summary><p class="para4">CSS helps you to keep the informational content of a document separate from the details of how to display it. The details of how to display the document are known as its style Your web site might have thousands of pages that look similar. Using CSS, you store the style information in common files that all the pages share. When a user displays a web page, the user’s browser loads the style information along with the content of the page. When a user prints a web page, you might provide different style information that makes the printed page easy to read.
      In general, you use HTML to describe the content of the document, not its style; you use CSS to specify its style, not its content. </p>

As of 2022, 98% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries. Wikipedia

      <details><summary>C Programming language:</summary>
        <p class="para1">C was initially used for system development work, particularly the programs that make-up the operating system. C was adopted as a system development language because it produces code that runs nearly as fast as the code written in assembly language. Some examples of the use of C might be − 
        <ul><li>Operating Systems</li>
         <li> Language Compilers</li>
         <li> Assemblers</li>
          <li>Text Editors</li>
          <li>Print Spoolers</li>
          <li>Network Drivers</li>

      <details><summary>C++ Programming language:</summary>
      <p class="para2">C++ is most popularly used for building large software infrastructure and applications that run on limited resources. Because C++ can directly manipulate the hardware (or machine) that it runs on, programmers can fine-tune their code to run efficiently in any environment, even when there’s limited hardware space or energy available to power the application. This translates to applications that run quickly and reliably on a variety of devices, making C++ ideal for forming the base layer of many important applications.</p>

      <details><summary>Bootsrap:</summary>
        <p class="para2">Bootstrap is an HTML, CSS and JS library that focuses on simplifying the development of informative web pages (as opposed to web applications). The primary purpose of adding it to a web project is to apply Bootstrap's choices of color, size, font and layout to that project. As such, the primary factor is whether the developers in charge find those choices to their liking. Once added to a project, Bootstrap provides basic style definitions for all HTML elements. The result is a uniform appearance for prose, tables and form elements across web browsers. In addition, developers can take advantage of CSS classes defined in Bootstrap to further customize the appearance of their contents. For example, Bootstrap has provisioned for light- and dark-colored tables, page headings, more prominent pull quotes, and text with a highlight.

          Bootstrap also comes with several JavaScript components which do not require other libraries like jQuery. They provide additional user interface elements such as dialog boxes, tooltips, progress bars, navigation drop-downs, and carousels. Each Bootstrap component consists of an HTML structure, CSS declarations, and in some cases accompanying JavaScript code. They also extend the functionality of some existing interface elements, including for example an auto-complete function for input fields.</p>

        <details><summary>PHP:</summary>
          <p class="para2">The term PHP is an acronym for Hypertext Preprocessor. It is a server-side scripting language that is used for web development. It can be easily embedded with HTML files. HTML codes can also be written in a PHP file. The PHP codes are executed on the server-side whereas HTML codes are directly executed on the browser.
            It is one of the widely used open-source general-purpose scripting language that is used for backend Development. Apart from this, let’s see why we should learn it.
            <ul>
            Easy to Learn: It is easier to learn for anyone who has come across to any programming language for the first time.
            Free of Cost: Since it is an open-source language, therefore developers are allowed to use its components and all methods for free.
            Flexible: Since It is a dynamically typed language, therefore there are no hard rules on how to build features using it.
            Supports nearly all databases: It supports all the widely used databases, including MySQL, ODBC, SQLite etc.
            Secured: It has multiple security levels provides us a secure platform for developing websites as it has multiple security levels.
            Huge Community Support: It is loved and used by a huge number of developers. The developers share their knowledge with other people of the community that want to know about it.</ul>
